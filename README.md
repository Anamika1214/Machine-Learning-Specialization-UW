# Machine Learning Specialization (using Python + GraphLab Create) - University of Washington (Coursera.org)
This repository is dedicated to all the assignments/lectures taught in Machine Learning Specialization through Coursera.org from University of Washington.
Courses in this specialization are:

1. Machine Learning Foundations
2. Regression
3. Classification
4. Clustering & Retrieval

All the assignments use GraphLab Create, iPython notebooks, Python version >=2.7, Numpy(for array/matrix manipulation), Scipy(computing), Pandas(Data analysis/cleaning), SFrame(equivalent of Dataframe), Matplotlib(for visualization).

Any suggestions are welcome. Fork the repo and push the changes, if they are improved versions of what is already written, I will overwrite/merge it. Make sure to commit with appropriate details.  

If you'd like to collaberate on some really interesting projects using Python/Java and Machine Learning, please do contact as this specialization was left without the last course (Recommendation & Dimensionality Reduction) from the university.
